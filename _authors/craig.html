Craig has been involved in the IT industry for over 10 years in the area of [Systems and Network Administration](http://sysadminday.com/ "Sysadmin Day"). He tries (sometimes successfully) to bring the same methodical discipline to his writing. Of particular interest is the intersection of politics, culture and religion.

Craig is a supporter of [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/ "GNU"), and codes, sporadically, at [GitHub](https://github.com/cholyoak "cholyoak").
